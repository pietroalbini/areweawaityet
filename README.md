# Are we await yet?

This website tracked the bickeshedding of [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org)'s
[async/await](https://areweasyncyet.rs) feature, and especially the syntax of
the `await` keyword. As the bikeshedding thankfully ended by now it has been
replaced with a static page, and the old source code has been moved to the
`archive/` directory.

The contents of this repository are released under the MIT license.

## Running

To generate the old website you need to move to the `archive/` directory and
run:

```
$ cargo run
```

The generated content will be present in the `archive/static` directory.
